# Simple PHP Banner Rotation #

I wrote a very simple banner rotater that can rotate all images in a directory hourly or daily.

## Usage ##

Put your banners in the $dir

Set the filename to this format:
    
    images/banners/website.com.gif
    
Where you include the website's address as the filename.

See the index.php for usage and example.
